* CPU Tests

The cpu tests are testing the cpu market of the monitor.

** Scenarios

A scenario file contains the informations about the VMs to launch, and which phoronix benchmark, and when to run it.
It is a yaml file, composed as follows : 

#+begin_src yaml :exports code
vms: 
   - name: vm_small # name of the VM, to reper them in the results
     vcpus: 2 
     memory: 4096
     frequency: 800 # The nominal frequency of the VMs
     instances: 4 # Number of instances to launch of that VM (vm_name1, vm_name2, ...)
     disk : 10000
     memorySLA : 0.9
     image : ubuntu-20.04
     phoronix: 
       benchmark: compress-7zip
       start: 0 # start the benchmark at instant 0, (when all the VM are booted, and scripts are installed)
   - name: vm_big
     vcpus: 2
     memory: 4096
     frequency: 2000
     instances: 2
     disk : 10000
     memorySLA : 0.9
     image : ubuntu-20.04
     phoronix: 
       benchmark: compress-7zip
       start: 1000 # start the benchmark at instant 1000 seconds
#+end_src


** Results

All the results are stored in the same mongodb database, in order to have a single archive for result sharing.
The cpu results are stored in the collection "cputests".
